# Template for Using Miniconda on Travis-CI for Continuous Integration Testing

Testing tricky Python extensions on Travis-CI using miniconda to speed up the environment setup and simplifying builds that include `C` code from projects like `numpy`.

Inspired by [cookiecutter-pylibrary](https://github.com/ionelmc/cookiecutter-pylibrary).

## Note

This can be used together with its twin [python-conda-appveyor](https://github.com/Midnighter/python-conda-appveyor) to have complete testing on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows using miniconda.
